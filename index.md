## About

<img class="profile-picture" src="avatarsquare.jpg">

I'm a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/) in UCL.

Before that, I've completed my PhD at the [Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences](https://elsc.huji.ac.il/) in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, working in the lab of Professor [Yonatan Loewenstein](https://loewenstein.huji.ac.il/). As an undergraduate, I studied Computer Science and Cognitive Sciences in the Hebrew University.

## Research Interests
My research focus is exploration behavior in complex environments, where decisions are made under uncertainty and have long-term (exploratory) consequences. I'm combining theoretical approaches, developing models and algorithms for effective exploration, with experimental approaches for studying exploratory behavior of humans in complex environments.

Besides Reinforcement Learning and exploration, I'm interested in the dynamics of neural computation, and in learning mechanisms of artificial and biological neural networks.

I have a special interest in the [history](https://liorfox.substack.com) of neural networks models in computational neuroscience, cognitive sciences, and AI.

## Contact
The best way of contact is by email: [lior.fox@mail.huji.ac.il](mailto:lior.fox@mail.huji.ac.il). 

I sometimes [tweet](https://twitter.com/__lfx), mostly non-academic stuff in Hebrew.

If you find yourself in London, you're welcome to visit me in the [GCNU](https://maps.app.goo.gl/78yJoUnorA6SRQE7A).
