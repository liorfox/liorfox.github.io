## About

<img class="profile-picture" src="avatarsquare.jpg">

I'm a PhD candidate at the [Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences](https://elsc.huji.ac.il/) in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, working in the lab of Professor [Yonatan Loewenstein](https://loewenstein.huji.ac.il/). 

Previously, I have completed my BSc in Computer Science and Cognitive Sciences, also at the Hebrew University.

## Research Interests
My research focus is exploration behavior in complex environments, where decisions are made under uncertainty and have long-term (exploratory) consequences. I'm combining theoretical approaches, developing models and algorithms for effective exploration, with experimental approaches for studying exploratory behavior of humans in complex environments.

Besides Reinforcement Learning and exploration, I'm interested in the dynamics of neural computation, and in learning mechanisms of artificial and biological neural networks.

I have a special interest in the history of neural networks in computational neuroscience, cognitive sciences, and AI.

## Contact
The best way of contact is by email: [lior.fox@mail.huji.ac.il](mailto:lior.fox@mail.huji.ac.il). 

I sometimes [tweet](https://twitter.com/__lfx), mostly non-academic stuff in Hebrew.

If you find yourself in Jerusalem, you're welcome to visit me in [Giv'at Ram](https://goo.gl/maps/KcUpnmyK6838Gw8b6).
