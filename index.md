## About

<img class="profile-picture" src="avatarsquare.jpg">

I'm a PhD candidate at [The Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences](https://elsc.huji.ac.il) at the [Hebrew Univesrity of Jerusalem](https://new.huji.ac.il/), working in the lab of Professor [Yonatan Loewenstein](https://loewenstein.huji.ac.il/). 

Before that, I have completed my BSc in Computer Science and Cognitive Sciences, also at the Hebrew University.

## Research Interest
My research focus is exploration behavior in complex environments, where decisions are made under uncertainty and have long-term (exploratory) consequences. I'm interested in combining theoretical approaches, developing models and algorithms for effective exploration, with an experimetnal approach for studying complex exporaltory behavior in humans.

Besides Reinforcement Learning and exploration, I'm ineresed in dynamics of neural computation, and in learning mechanisms in artificial and biological neural networks.

I'm passionate about the history of neural networks studies in computational neuroscience, cognitive sciences, and AI.

## Contant
The best way of contant is by email: [lior.fox@mail.huji.ac.il](mailto:lior.fox@mail.huji.ac.il). 

I sometimes [tweet](https://twitter.com/__lfx), mostly non-academic stuff in Hebrew.

If you find yourself in Jerusalem, you're welcome to visit me in [Giv'at Ram](https://goo.gl/maps/KcUpnmyK6838Gw8b6).
